- **unix-privesc-check**
  - Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems (tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2). It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases).

It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because it can read more files).

## Password Attack

- **CEWL**
  - CeWL (Custom Word List generator) is a ruby app which spiders a given URL, up to a specified depth, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper. Optionally, CeWL can follow external links.

CeWL can also create a list of email addresses found in mailto links. These email addresses can be used as usernames in brute force actions.

Another tool provided by CeWL project is FAB (Files Already Bagged). FAB extracts the content of the author/creator fields, from metadata of the some files, to create lists of possible usernames. These usernames can be used in association with the password list generated by CeWL. FAB uses the same metadata extraction techniques that CeWL. Currently, FAB process Office pre 2007, Office 2007 and PDF formats.

CeWL is useful in security tests and forensics investigations. CeWL is pronounced “cool”.

- **Medusa**
  - Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer. The goal is to support as many services which allow remote authentication as possible. The author considers following items as some of the key features of this application: * Thread-based parallel testing. Brute-force testing can be performed against multiple hosts, users or passwords concurrently. * Flexible user input. Target information (host/user/password) can be specified in a variety of ways. For example, each item can be either a single entry or a file containing multiple entries. Additionally, a combination file format allows the user to refine their target listing. * Modular design. Each service module exists as an independent .mod file. This means that no modifications are necessary to the core application in order to extend the supported list of services for brute-forcing.

- **Ncrack**
  - Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. Security professionals also rely on Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts.

Ncrack’s features include a very flexible interface granting the user full control of network operations, allowing for very sophisticated bruteforcing attacks, timing templates for ease of use, runtime interaction similar to Nmap’s and many more. Protocols supported include RDP, SSH, http(s), SMB, pop3(s), VNC, FTP, and telnet.
