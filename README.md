## Password Attack

- **CEWL**
  - CeWL (Custom Word List generator) is a ruby app which spiders a given URL, up to a specified depth, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper. Optionally, CeWL can follow external links.

CeWL can also create a list of email addresses found in mailto links. These email addresses can be used as usernames in brute force actions.

Another tool provided by CeWL project is FAB (Files Already Bagged). FAB extracts the content of the author/creator fields, from metadata of the some files, to create lists of possible usernames. These usernames can be used in association with the password list generated by CeWL. FAB uses the same metadata extraction techniques that CeWL. Currently, FAB process Office pre 2007, Office 2007 and PDF formats.

CeWL is useful in security tests and forensics investigations. CeWL is pronounced “cool”.

- **Medusa**
  - Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer. The goal is to support as many services which allow remote authentication as possible. The author considers following items as some of the key features of this application: * Thread-based parallel testing. Brute-force testing can be performed against multiple hosts, users or passwords concurrently. * Flexible user input. Target information (host/user/password) can be specified in a variety of ways. For example, each item can be either a single entry or a file containing multiple entries. Additionally, a combination file format allows the user to refine their target listing. * Modular design. Each service module exists as an independent .mod file. This means that no modifications are necessary to the core application in order to extend the supported list of services for brute-forcing.

From enumerating logged on users and spidering SMB shares to executing psexec style attacks, auto-injecting Mimikatz/Shellcode/DLL’s into memory using Powershell, dumping the NTDS.dit and more.

The biggest improvements over the above tools are:

Pure Python script, no external tools required
Fully concurrent threading
Uses ONLY native WinAPI calls for discovering sessions, users, dumping SAM hashes etc…
Opsec safe (no binaries are uploaded to dump clear-text credentials, inject shellcode etc…)
Additionally, a database is used to store used/dumped credentals. It also automatically correlates Admin credentials to hosts and vice-versa allowing you to easily keep track of credential sets and gain additional situational awareness in large environments.

MAC addresses are unique identifiers on networks, they only need to be unique, they can be changed on most network hardware. MAC addresses have started to be abused by unscrupulous marketing firms, government agencies, and others to provide an easy way to track a computer across multiple networks. By changing the MAC address regularly, this kind of tracking can be thwarted, or at least made a lot more difficult.

Features:

set specific MAC address of a network interface
set the MAC randomly
set a MAC of another vendor
set another MAC of the same vendor
set a MAC of the same kind (eg: wireless card)
display a vendor MAC list (today, 6200 items) to choose from

- **Netsniff-Ng**
  - netsniff-ng is a high performance Linux network sniffer for packet inspection. It can be used for protocol analysis, reverse engineering or network debugging. The gain of performance is reached by ‘zero-copy’ mechanisms, so that the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernelspace to userspace.

netsniff-ng toolkit currently consists of the following utilities:

netsniff-ng: a zero-copy packet analyzer, pcap capturing/replaying tool
trafgen: a multithreaded low-level zero-copy network packet generator
mausezahn: high-level packet generator for appliances with Cisco-CLI
ifpps: a top-like kernel networking and system statistics tool
curvetun: a lightweight curve25519-based multiuser IP tunnel

It will answer to specific NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name suffix (see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409). By default, the tool will only answer to File Server Service request, which is for SMB.

The concept behind this is to target your answers, and be stealthier on the network. This also helps to ensure that you don’t break legitimate NBT-NS behavior. You can set the -r option via command line if you want to answer to the Workstation Service request name suffix.

- **Scapy**
  - Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation tool, packet generator, network scanner, network discovery, packet sniffer, etc. It can for the moment replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f, ….

In scapy you define a set of packets, then it sends them, receives answers, matches requests with answers and returns a list of packet couples (request, answer) and a list of unmatched packets. This has the big advantage over tools like nmap or hping that an answer is not reduced to (open/closed/filtered), but is the whole packet.

This package contains the Python 3 version of the library and scapy executable.

## Post-Exploitation

- **Evil-Winrm**
  -This package contains the ultimate WinRM shell for hacking/pentesting.

WinRM (Windows Remote Management) is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Management Protocol. A standard SOAP based protocol that allows hardware and operating systems from different vendors to interoperate. Microsoft included it in their Operating Systems in order to make life easier to system administrators.

This program can be used on any Microsoft Windows Servers with this feature enabled (usually at port 5985), of course only if you have credentials and permissions to use it. So it could be used in a post-exploitation hacking/pentesting phase. The purpose of this program is to provide nice and easy-to-use features for hacking. It can be used with legitimate purposes by system administrators as well but the most of its features are focused on hacking/pentesting stuff.

It is using PSRP (Powershell Remoting Protocol) for initializing runspace pools as well as creating and processing pipelines.
